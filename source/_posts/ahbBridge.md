<p>
The aim of the project is to replace the Leon3 open source soft processor with ARM's
Cortex M0 processor. Since Leon3 processor uses AHB interface and Cortex M0 uses
AHB-LITE, a bridge is required for the Cortex M0 to switch between the protocols,
communicating with the peripherals found in the system on chip (SoC) Design.
The main objectives of the project can be summarised as follows:
 <li>Replace Leon 3 processor with Cortex M0 processor, producing functional code for
both simulation and implementation.</li>
 <li>Learn the constraints in replacing processors and the relevant coding and timing
issues.</li>
 <li>Gain understanding on the signicance of two important protocols which are heavily
used in many applications i.e AHB and AHB LITE.</li>
