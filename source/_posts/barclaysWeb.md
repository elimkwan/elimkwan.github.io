<p>This summer, I joined Barclays as technology summer intern. It was a challenging, yet rewarding experience.</p>
<br>
<h1 style="color:#7ecaf6;" class="fas fa-briefcase"> Planning Poker </h1>
JIRA and different planning tools has gained increasing popularity and are particularly useful for managing big and complicated projects. Therefore, our team is developing a <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Planning Poker tool.</a>  It is an agile estimating and planning technique that help teams to estimate their product backlogs.

<p>Stacks used: </p>
<li>Angular for front end</li>
<li>Golang for backend</li>
<li>Deployed on Amazon Fargate</li>

<p>I was mainly in charged of front end development, building up features and styling pages with Angular Material Modules. I then moved on to work on integration with the back end, sending HTTP requests to store and retrieve information from the server. After that, I also tried out Golang and worked on the user management system at the backend server. </p>
<p>Entering phase two of the project, we started to deploy it with Amazon AWS EC2 instances and Fargate. With deployment on the fly, we had a hard time catching up with front-end testing. Lesson of the day is we should not leave unit tests till the last minute. In addition, we also started to have proper JIRA and sprint planning session, using our very own Planning Poker Tool to set the story point. This hugely improved our efficiency and is a rewarding moment for the team because we are the product that we developed. </p>

<h1 style="color:#7ecaf6;" class="fas fa-briefcase"> Other Business Objectives </h1>
The internship is not just about coding. I have also attended a lot of trainings and networking sessions. 
To name but just a few:
<li>a) Risk and Financial training</li>
<li>b) Quantative Analysis</li>
<li>c) Machine Learning</li>
<li>d) Cyber Security</li>
<li>e) Crytography</li>
<li>f) Ventures</li>

<p>I also have the chance to met various directors and managing directors to understand more about their view on future tech, business and their roles, which are quite insightful and inspiring. </p>
