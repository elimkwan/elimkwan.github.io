I worked at <a href="https://kazootechnology.com/">Kazoo Technology</a> last summer. It is a hardware startup that develop alternative solutions to Near-Field Technology.

I was responsible for improving the layout of their next phase product, and building smart card protocol, which involved drawing, assembling and soldering Printed Circuit Board and building a simple app for testing product’s transmission bit rate.
